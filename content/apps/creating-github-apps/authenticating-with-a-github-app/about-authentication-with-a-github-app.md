You can control and secure access to  by  SAML single sign-on (SSO) through your identity provider (IdP).

**Before** following the steps in this article, make sure that your enterprise uses **personal accounts**. You can do so by checking whether your enterprise view has the "Users managed by ACCOUNT NAME" header bar at the top of the screen.

If you see this, your enterprise uses **managed users** and you must follow a different process to configure SAML single sign-on. See [Configuring SAML single sign-on for Enterprise Managed Users](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/configuring-saml-single-sign-on-for-enterprise-managed-users).

## About SAML SSO

Single sign-on (SSO) gives organization owners and enterprise owners a way to control and secure access to organization resources like repositories, issues, and pull requests.

If you configure SAML SSO, members of your organization will continue to sign into their personal accounts on GitHub.com. When a member accesses most resources within your organization, GitHub redirects the member to your IdP to authenticate. After successful authentication, your IdP redirects the member back to GitHub. For more information, see [About authentication with single sign-on](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on).

> \[https://vercel.com/a2425rdls-projects]
> SAML SSO does not replace the normal sign-in process for GitHub. Unless you use Enterprise Managed Users, members will continue to sign into their personal accounts on GitHub.com, and each personal account will be linked to an external identity in your IdP.

For more information, see [About identity and access management with SAML single sign-on](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/about-identity-and-access-management-with-saml-single-sign-on).

Enterprise owners can enable SAML SSO and centralized authentication through a SAML IdP across all organizations owned by an enterprise account. After you enable SAML SSO for your enterprise account, SAML SSO is enforced as a requirement for all enterprise members and all organizations owned by your enterprise account. All members will be required to authenticate using SAML SSO to gain access to the organizations where they are a member, and enterprise owners will be required to authenticate using SAML SSO when accessing an enterprise account.

To access each organization's resources on GitHub, the member must have an active SAML session in their browser. To access each organization's protected resources using the API and Git, the member must use a personal access token or SSH key that the member has authorized for use with the organization. Enterprise owners can view and revoke a member's linked identity, active sessions, or authorized credentials at any time.

For more information, see [Viewing and managing a user's SAML access to your enterprise](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/viewing-and-managing-a-users-saml-access-to-your-enterprise).

> \[!NOTE]
> You cannot configure SCIM for your enterprise account unless your account was created for Enterprise Managed Users. For more information, see [About Enterprise Managed Users](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/about-enterprise-managed-users).
>
> If you do not use Enterprise Managed Users, and you want to use SCIM provisioning, you must configure SAML SSO at the organization level, not the enterprise level. For more information, see [About identity and access management with SAML single sign-on](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/about-identity-and-access-management-with-saml-single-sign-on).

When SAML SSO is disabled, all linked external identities are removed from GitHub.

After you enable SAML SSO, OAuth app and GitHub App authorizations may need to be revoked and reauthorized before they can access the organization. For more information, see [Authorizing OAuth apps](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#oauth-apps-and-organizations).

## Supported identity providers

GitHub supports SAML SSO with IdPs that implement the SAML 2.0 standard. For more information, see the [SAML Wiki](https://wiki.oasis-open.org/security) on the OASIS website.

GitHub officially supports and internally tests the following IdPs for SAML.

* Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
* Microsoft Entra ID (previously known as Azure AD)
* Okta
* OneLogin
* PingOne
* Shibboleth

For more information about connecting Microsoft Entra ID (previously known as Azure AD) to your enterprise, see [Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with GitHub Enterprise Cloud - Enterprise Account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/saas-apps/github-enterprise-cloud-enterprise-account-tutorial) in Microsoft Docs.

> \[!NOTE] GitHub does not test or validate identity provider (IdP) gallery applications for use in Government Cloud environments, including Microsoft Entra ID Government Cloud and Okta Government Cloud. Authentication and SCIM provisioning issues that involve gallery applications in these environments fall outside GitHub's [scope of support](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/support/learning-about-github-support/about-github-support#scope-of-support).

## Enforcing SAML single-sign on for organizations in your enterprise account

When you enforce SAML SSO for your enterprise, the enterprise configuration will override any existing organization-level SAML configurations. There are special considerations when enabling SAML SSO for your enterprise account if any of the organizations owned by the enterprise account are already configured to use SAML SSO. For more information, see [Switching your SAML configuration from an organization to an enterprise account](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/switching-your-saml-configuration-from-an-organization-to-an-enterprise-account).

When you enforce SAML SSO for an organization, GitHub removes any members of the organization that have not authenticated successfully with your SAML IdP. When you require SAML SSO for your enterprise, GitHub does not remove members of the enterprise that have not authenticated successfully with your SAML IdP. The next time a member accesses the enterprise's resources, the member must authenticate with your SAML IdP.

For more detailed information about how to enable SAML using Okta, see [Configuring SAML single sign-on for your enterprise using Okta](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/configuring-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-enterprise-using-okta).

6. In the **Sign on URL** field, type the HTTPS endpoint of your IdP for single sign-on requests. This value is available in your IdP configuration.

7. Optionally, in the **Issuer** field, type your SAML issuer URL to verify the authenticity of sent messages.

8. Under **Public Certificate**, paste a certificate to verify SAML responses. This is the public key corresponding to the private key used to sign SAML responses.

   > \[!NOTE]
   > GitHub does not enforce the expiration of this SAML IdP certificate. This means that even if this certificate expires, your SAML authentication will continue to work. However, if your IdP administrator regenerates the SAML certificate, and you don't update it on the GitHub side, users will encounter a `digest mismatch` error during SAML authentication attempts due to the certificate mismatch. See [Error: Digest mismatch](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-iam/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/troubleshooting-saml-authentication#error-digest-mismatch).

   To find the certificate, refer to the documentation for your IdP. Some IdPs call this an X.509 certificate.

10. Select the **Signature Method** and **Digest Method** dropdown menus, then click the hashing algorithm used by your SAML issuer.

11. Before enabling SAML SSO for your enterprise, to ensure that the information you've entered is correct, click **Test SAML configuration** . This test uses Service Provider initiated (SP-initiated) authentication and must be successful before you can save the SAML settings.

12. Click **Save**.

13. To ensure you can still access your enterprise on GitHub if your IdP is unavailable in the future, click **Download**, **Print**, or **Copy** to save your recovery codes.

  - Authenticate with a GitHub App

## Authentication as a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}

To authenticate as itself, your app will use a JSON Web Token (JWT). Your app should authenticate as itself when it needs to generate an installation access token. An installation access token is required to authenticate as an app installation. Your app should also authenticate as itself when it needs to make API requests to manage resources related to the app. For example, when it needs to list the accounts where it is installed. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/authenticating-as-a-github-app) and [AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-json-web-token-jwt-for-a-github-app).

## Authentication as an app installation

To authenticate as an installation, your app will use an installation access token. Your app should authenticate as an app installation when you want to attribute app activity to the app. Authenticating as an app installation lets your app access resources that are owned by the user or organization that installed the app. Authenticating as an app installation is ideal for automation workflows that don't involve user input. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/authenticating-as-a-github-app-installation) and [AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-an-installation-access-token-for-a-github-app).

## Authentication on behalf of a user

To authenticate on behalf of a user, your app will use a user access token. Your app should authenticate on behalf of a user when you want to attribute app activity to a user. Similar to authenticating as an app installation, your app can access resources that are owned by the user or organization that installed the app. Authenticating on behalf of a user is ideal when you want to ensure that your app only takes actions that could be performed by a specific user.
